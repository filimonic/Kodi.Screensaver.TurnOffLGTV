For my WebOS TV with problem that LG TV does not support `CEC STANDBY` command, 
I switched to hardware workaround: [cec_lg_off](https://github.com/ALFISYS/cec_lg_off)

<hr>

This repository supported anymore because I do not use Kodi anymore.
Please follow [BillyNate's release](https://github.com/BillyNate/Kodi.Script.TurnOffLGTV)
